# Rootstock NFT Minting Platform

This project is a full-stack solution for minting Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) on the Rootstock (RSK) blockchain, leveraging decentralized storage via IPFS and seamless smart contract deployment.

## Key Features

- **NFT Minting on Rootstock:**  
  Users can mint ERC-721 compliant NFTs directly on the Rootstock testnet, ensuring compatibility with the broader Ethereum ecosystem while benefiting from Rootstock's security and low fees.

- **IPFS-Powered Media Storage:**  
  Images and metadata associated with each NFT are uploaded to the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) using the Pinata service. This guarantees that NFT assets are stored in a decentralized, tamper-proof manner, independent of any single server.

- **Automated Metadata Generation:**  
  The platform automatically generates ERC-721 standard metadata for each NFT, including name, description, image link (IPFS CID), and customizable attributes.

- **Smart Contract Deployment:**  
  The system deploys a new NFT smart contract (based on OpenZeppelin's ERC-721 implementation) to the Rootstock testnet, allowing for unique collections and ownership management.

- **User-Friendly CLI Workflow:**  
  The project includes a command-line interface that guides users through the process of uploading images, generating metadata, deploying contracts, and minting NFTsâ€”all with simple prompts.

## Typical Workflow

1. **Image Upload:**  
   The user provides a path to an image file, which is uploaded to IPFS via Pinata.

2. **Metadata Creation:**  
   The system generates a metadata JSON file referencing the uploaded image and uploads this metadata to IPFS.

3. **Contract Deployment:**  
   A new ERC-721 contract is deployed to the Rootstock testnet.

4. **NFT Minting:**  
   The NFT is minted to the user's address, with the token URI pointing to the IPFS-hosted metadata.

5. **Result Output:**  
   The user receives the IPFS CIDs, contract address, transaction hash, and token ID for their minted NFT.

## Technologies Used

- **Rootstock (RSK) Blockchain**
- **Hardhat (for contract deployment and scripting)**
- **Pinata SDK (for IPFS uploads)**
- **Node.js (CLI and scripting)**
- **OpenZeppelin Contracts (ERC-721 standard)**
